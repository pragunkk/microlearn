  "summary": "Liz Truss served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a brief but tumultuous period in 2022. A member of the Conservative Party, she rose through the ranks, holding positions like Environment Secretary and Foreign Secretary. Her leadership campaign focused on tax cuts and deregulation, aimed at stimulating economic growth. Upon assuming office, she introduced a 'mini-budget' that included significant tax cuts, which triggered market instability, a drop in the pound's value, and concerns about government debt. Facing immense pressure from within her party and the public, she reversed some of her policies and replaced her Chancellor of the Exchequer. Ultimately, after just 49 days in office, Truss resigned, making her the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history. Her tenure is largely remembered for the economic turmoil and political instability that defined her brief time at the helm.",
