  "topic": "Snapchat",
  "summary": "Snapchat is a hugely popular social media platform known for its ephemeral content. Users primarily share photos and short videos, called 'Snaps,' which disappear after a set amount of time, ranging from seconds to 24 hours for Stories. Its defining feature is this focus on impermanence, encouraging spontaneous and unfiltered sharing. Beyond disappearing Snaps, Snapchat offers features like lenses, filters, and geofilters that overlay digital effects onto images. Chatting, video calls, and the 'Discover' page, which features content from media outlets, are other key components. Snapchat's demographic skews younger, making it a powerful platform for reaching that audience. While its focus on privacy and ephemeral content has appeal, concerns remain about potential misuse and the pressure of constantly creating content. Its innovative format has heavily influenced other social media platforms.",
